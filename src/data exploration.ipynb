       "      <td>. I just watched a 4 hour long disclosure buffet my greer. I honestly have no reason I would doubt him. He had extensive knowledge. His history and accounts are all verifiable. He has incredibly powerful and high up people informing or working with him. This video I'm pretty sure was ten years old have no idea what he's up to these days. I am impressed he just comes out and tells you what he knows and I'm sure the only reason he's Alive is because no one could even make this stuff up. If everything he says is true I don't know how he copes with a reality like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Although Tom DeLonge has some impressive sounding people in his \"accadedemy\" they are a few very smart people with nice sounding titles Lou Elizando who I admire for wanting to disclose, was only running a program that was disinfo at best. Head of aerospace threat identification program sounds for the Pentagon sounds super impressive but if greer is telling the truth he was a government coffee boy. I would bet my life savings Trump I would never be read into magic12 or even told anything more than what keeps him entertained. His books were very fun to read and incredibly fun. If you know about nazj Germany, vril, anartica, the post ww2 expedition, area 51, and all the publicly documented sightings in public knowledge you will learn nothing but the fictional stories about people involved in the deepest levels are a fun \"look in\". I think Tom wants to find out the \"truth\" whatever the hell that is, but is way over his head. Probably half his team are people that are in the know set to spread disinfo. It gets people thinking though but like I usually say baby steps are always good.</td>\n",

       "1  . I just watched a 4 hour long disclosure buffet my greer. I honestly have no reason I would doubt him. He had extensive knowledge. His history and accounts are all verifiable. He has incredibly powerful and high up people informing or working with him. This video I'm pretty sure was ten years old have no idea what he's up to these days. I am impressed he just comes out and tells you what he knows and I'm sure the only reason he's Alive is because no one could even make this stuff up. If everything he says is true I don't know how he copes with a reality like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Although Tom DeLonge has some impressive sounding people in his \"accadedemy\" they are a few very smart people with nice sounding titles Lou Elizando who I admire for wanting to disclose, was only running a program that was disinfo at best. Head of aerospace threat identification program sounds for the Pentagon sounds super impressive but if greer is telling the truth he was a government coffee boy. I would bet my life savings Trump I would never be read into magic12 or even told anything more than what keeps him entertained. His books were very fun to read and incredibly fun. If you know about nazj Germany, vril, anartica, the post ww2 expedition, area 51, and all the publicly documented sightings in public knowledge you will learn nothing but the fictional stories about people involved in the deepest levels are a fun \"look in\". I think Tom wants to find out the \"truth\" whatever the hell that is, but is way over his head. Probably half his team are people that are in the know set to spread disinfo. It gets people thinking though but like I usually say baby steps are always good.  \n",
